    <h3>The Mojito</h3>
    <h4>Origins</h4>
    <p>The Mojit is a refreshing and timeless cocktail, tracing its origins to Cuba, with a history as vibrant as its flavors. This iconic drink is believed to have emerged in the early 16th century, during the Spanish colonial era. Its birthplace, Havana, was a melting pot of cultures and flavors, contributing to the Mojito's unique character. The original concoction was a medicinal elixir, blending a mix of local ingredients such as sugar cane-derived rum, lime, mint leaves, and sugar. Over time, the Mojito evolved into a beloved cocktail, gaining international recognition thanks to influential figures like Ernest Hemingway, who frequented Havana's bars and helped popularize the drink. Today, the Mojito stands as a symbol of Cuban heritage, celebrated worldwide for its zesty, minty, and revitalizing taste.</p>
